## Submission Instructions

### Overview

For my project I plan to create a home maintenance checklist and schedule. Today more people are living longer than ever yet the long time frame and easy to over look nature of some home maintenance plus the need for skills and resources makes it harder for most to stay in their home. 

A scheduler that can alert the home owner, relatives, or neighbors to can extend the livable years someone has in their home, while also being a road map to the next inhabitants of what a given home requires to be maintained.

### What I'll Have to Learn

I'll have to learn how to use the tools available in Java to handle time and events, so I'll be able to set reminders and notifications.

Depending on the setup, I will want to learn how to allow Users to set reminders that other people will be able to access or respond to without providing the same privledges that the User who created the reminder might have.
